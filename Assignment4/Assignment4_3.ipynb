    "This is a character-level language model using recurrent neural networks based Sequence GAN (SeqGAN).\n",

    "https://github.com/LantaoYu/SeqGAN\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, you are allowed to copy paste the codes from the original repo with an additional effort to apply it to our data.\n",
    "HOWEVER, try to implement the model yourself first, and consider the original source code as a last resort.\n",
    "You will learn a lot while wrapping around your head during the implementation. And you will understand more clearly in a code level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, IF YOU JUST BLINDLY COPY PASTE THE CODE, YOU SHALL RUIN YOUR EXAM.\n",
    "### The exam is designed to be solvable for students that actually have written the code themselves.\n",
    "At least strictly re-type the codes from the original repo line-by-line, and understand what each line means thoroughly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now proceed to the code. You may use textloader in previous assingment or not. You can \n",
    "freely create another python files (\\*.py) and then import them. Following codes can be modified as you want. Just make sure that SeqGAN training works.\n",
